# Basic Java Programs

Welcome to the **Basic Java Programs** repository! This repository contains a collection of foundational Java programs designed to help learners and developers build a strong understanding of Java programming concepts. Each program demonstrates key principles and provides various methods for solving common problems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into individual folders for each program. Each folder includes different methods to solve the program, allowing you to explore multiple approaches and techniques. 

### Program List

1. **HelloWorld**
   - **File:** `HelloWorld.java`
   - **Description:** A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. **SumOfTwoNumbers**
   - **File:** `SumOfTwoNumbers.java`
   - **Description:** A program that takes two integers as input and prints their sum.

3. **EvenOrOdd**
   - **File:** `EvenOrOdd.java`
   - **Description:** A program that determines whether a given number is even or odd.

4. **LargestOfThreeNumbers**
   - **File:** `LargestOfThreeNumbers.java`
   - **Description:** A program that finds and prints the largest of three given numbers.
  
5. **PrimeNumberChecker**
   - **File:** `PrimeNumberChecker.java`
   - **Description:** A program to check whether a given number is a prime number.
  
6. **Factorial**
   - **File:** `Factorial.java`
   - **Description:** A program to calculate the factorial of a given number.

### Folder Structure

Each program is contained within its own folder. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- **Single Method Programs:** If a program has only one method to solve, the Java file is placed directly in the program's folder without additional sub-folders.
- **Method Sub-Folders:** Sub-folders named "Method 1", "Method 2", etc., each containing a Java file that demonstrates different methods to solve the program.


### Getting Started

To get started with these programs:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itznick/basic-java-programs.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired program folder:
   ```bash
   cd basic-java-programs/HelloWorld
   ```

3. Compile and run the Java file using the following commands:
   ```bash
   javac HelloWorld.java
   java HelloWorld
   ```
